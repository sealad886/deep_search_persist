# Test Requirements for deep_search_persist Package

## Testing Strategy Overview

Following the SPARC cycle methodology (Specification -> Pseudocode -> Architecture -> Refinement -> Completion), this document outlines the comprehensive testing requirements for the `deep_search_persist` package.

## Key Functional Areas to Test

### API Endpoints

*   Input validation (positive/negative cases)
*   Response formats and status codes
*   Error handling and edge cases
*   Authentication and authorization

### Persistence Layer

*   Data storage and retrieval
*   Session persistence
*   Concurrency handling
*   Data integrity checks

### Helper Functions

*   Input/output transformations
*   Data processing logic
*   Error cases and edge conditions

### Configuration Management

*   Environment variable handling
*   Configuration file parsing
*   Default values and overrides

### Docker Integration

*   Container startup/shutdown
*   Environment configuration
*   Volume mounts and persistence
*   Networking and port exposure

## Test Case Categories

### Unit Tests

*   Test individual functions/methods in isolation.
*   Mock external dependencies.
*   Cover all code paths (happy path + error cases).

### Integration Tests

*   Test component interactions.
*   Verify data flow between modules.
*   Test with real dependencies where appropriate.

### System Tests

*   End-to-end functionality.
*   Performance under load.
*   Error recovery scenarios.

### Docker-Specific Tests

*   Container builds successfully.
*   Services start correctly.
*   Configuration is properly injected.
*   Data persists across container restarts.

## Test Data Requirements

*   Valid and invalid input samples.
*   Edge case values (empty, null, max limits).
*   Realistic data volumes for performance testing.
*   Error condition triggers.

## Validation Criteria

Each test must verify:

*   Correct output for given input.
*   Proper error handling.
*   Performance within acceptable thresholds.
*   Compliance with specifications.

## Estimated Timeline

*   Unit tests: 2 weeks
*   Integration tests: 1 week
*   System tests: 1 week
*   Docker tests: 3 days
*   Total: ~4 weeks

## Next Steps

*   Create detailed test cases for each functional area.
*   Implement test automation framework.
*   Execute test suites.
*   Analyze results and refine tests.
