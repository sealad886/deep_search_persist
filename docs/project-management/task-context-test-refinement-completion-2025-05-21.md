# Test Refinement and Completion Strategies (SPARC Cycle)

This document outlines the strategies for iteratively improving test coverage and quality during the Refinement phase of each SPARC cycle and the process for finalizing the test suite during the Completion phase for the `deep-search-persist` project.

## Refinement Phase: Iterative Test Improvement within SPARC Cycles

The Refinement phase within each SPARC cycle is crucial for continuous improvement of the test suite. It involves a feedback loop from the preceding phases (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture) and ongoing development work.

1.  **Code Coverage Analysis and Gap Identification:**
    *   Utilize code coverage tools (e.g., `coverage.py` with `pytest`) to generate detailed reports after test execution.
    *   Analyze reports to identify areas of the codebase with low or no test coverage.
    *   Prioritize addressing gaps in critical modules, helper functions (aiming for 95% as per test requirements), and API endpoints (aiming for 100% endpoint coverage).
    *   Create new unit and integration tests specifically targeting identified gaps.

2.  **Ensuring Test Robustness and Resilience:**
    *   Review existing tests for flakiness or instability. Identify root causes (e.g., reliance on external factors, improper synchronization, test data issues).
    *   Refactor tests to use more reliable locators (for E2E), better mocking/stubbing strategies (for integration tests), and robust waiting mechanisms.
    *   Implement parameterized tests to cover a wider range of inputs and edge cases identified during development.
    *   Ensure tests are resilient to minor codebase changes by testing behavior rather than implementation details where appropriate.

3.  **Aligning Test Documentation with Project Documentation:**
    *   Update test documentation (e.g., test case descriptions, test plans) to reflect changes in the application or test suite.
    *   Ensure consistency between test documentation and project documentation (e.g., README, API specifications, requirements documents).
    *   Document new test scenarios, changes to existing tests, and updates to the test environment setup.
    *   Maintain a clear mapping between requirements (from `docs/requirements/test-requirements-spec.md`) and test cases to ensure traceability.

4.  **Validating Docker Compose Compatibility:**
    *   Regularly execute tests within the Docker environment defined by `docker-compose.persist.yml` and `Dockerfile`.
    *   Verify that the test suite runs successfully within the containerized setup.
    *   Validate service discovery, networking, and volume mounts as defined in the Docker Compose file.
    *   Ensure environment variables are correctly propagated and utilized by the application and tests within Docker.
    *   Test the healthcheck endpoints defined for services to ensure they accurately reflect service status.

5.  **Feedback Loop Integration:**
    *   **Specification Feedback:** Refine test requirements and acceptance criteria based on implementation challenges or newly identified needs.
    *   **Pseudocode Feedback:** Adjust test scenarios and logic based on the actual code implementation and discovered edge cases.
    *   **Architecture Feedback:** Modify the test suite structure, tooling, or environment strategy based on architectural changes or performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Implementation Feedback:** Address bugs found during manual or automated testing by writing new tests to cover the fixed issues and prevent regressions. Use code coverage reports to guide where more tests are needed.

## Completion Phase: Finalizing the Test Suite

The Completion phase marks the point where the test suite is considered finalized for a given scope or release. It involves a comprehensive validation to ensure readiness.

1.  **Achieving 100% Feature Coverage:**
    *   Review the `docs/requirements/test-requirements-spec.md` to ensure all specified functional and non-functional requirements have corresponding test cases.
    *   Utilize the traceability matrix (as outlined in `docs/project-management/task-context-test-architecture-2025-05-21.md`) to confirm that each requirement is covered by at least one test case.
    *   Develop any missing test cases required to achieve full coverage based on the specification.

2.  **Cross-Platform Verification (If Applicable):**
    *   If the application is intended to run on multiple operating systems or architectures (as suggested by multi-architecture build verification in `task-context-test-architecture-2025-05-21.md`), execute the test suite on each target platform.
    *   Verify that tests pass consistently across all supported environments.
    *   Address any platform-specific issues or test failures.

3.  **Automated Test Execution within Docker Environment:**
    *   The primary execution environment for the final test suite must be the Docker setup defined by `docker-compose.persist.yml` and `Dockerfile`.
    *   Ensure all test types (unit, integration, system/E2E) can be triggered and executed automatically within this environment.
    *   Verify that tests correctly interact with other services (e.g., MongoDB, SearXNG, Ollama) running as Docker containers.

4.  **Validation of Docker Setup Functionality:**
    *   Beyond just running tests, explicitly validate that the Docker setup itself is correct. This includes:
        *   Successful image builds.
        *   Correct service linking and networking.
        *   Proper volume mounts for persistence and configuration.
        *   Accurate environment variable configuration.
        *   Container health checks passing.
        *   Clean shutdown and startup of all services.

5.  **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**
    *   Integrate the finalized test suite into the CI/CD pipeline (as depicted in `task-context-test-architecture-2025-05-21.md`).
    *   Configure the pipeline to automatically build Docker images, spin up the test environment using Docker Compose, execute the full test suite, and generate reports on every code commit or pull request.
    *   Implement quality gates based on test results (e.g., fail the build if tests fail or coverage targets are not met).

6.  **Comprehensive Test Report Generation:**
    *   Configure test runners and coverage tools to generate detailed and easily understandable reports.
    *   Reports should include:
        *   Overall test pass/fail status.
        *   Breakdown of results by test type (unit, integration, system).
        *   Code coverage metrics (line, branch, function).
        *   Performance metrics (if performance tests are included).
        *   Security scan results (if security testing is automated).
        *   Logs and error details for failed tests.
    *   Ensure reports are accessible and archived for future reference.

7.  **Criteria for SPARC Cycle Completion:**
    *   All test cases within the scope of the current SPARC cycle pass consistently in the Dockerized environment.
    *   Code coverage targets for the affected code are met or exceeded.
    *   All critical bugs identified during the cycle are fixed and verified with tests.
    *   Test documentation is up-to-date and aligned with project documentation.
    *   The test suite is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and passes automatically.
    *   Test reports are generated and reviewed.
    *   Stakeholders agree that the quality level achieved is sufficient for the current stage.
