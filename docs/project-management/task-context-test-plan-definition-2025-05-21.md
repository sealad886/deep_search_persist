# Task Context: Define Comprehensive Test Plan for deep_search_persist

**Task ID:** test-plan-definition-2025-05-21

**User Request:**
Define comprehensive test requirements for the `'deep_search_persist`' package. Detail all functionalities to be tested, including positive and negative scenarios, edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, invalid data types), error handling conditions, and integration points with other components. Explicitly state that this phase is about defining *what* needs to be tested, not *how*. Include the need for tests to validate correct behavior within a Dockerized environment.

Pseudocode: Outline a high-level algorithmic approach for developing test cases using a SPARC iteration cycle (Specification -> Pseudocode -> Architecture -> Refinement -> Completion). Describe steps such as identifying key functions and modules within `'deep_search_persist`', determining appropriate input data sets (including boundary values), defining expected outputs, and outlining the process of validating containerization setup. Focus on describing the *process* of creating tests; avoid specific code examples.

Architecture: Propose a test suite architecture suitable for `'deep_search_persist`', designed to facilitate SPARC iterations. Include suggestions for directory structure (e.g., separate directories for unit, integration, and system tests), dependency management within the test environment, and integration with the Docker Compose file (`'docker/docker-compose.persist.yml`)' and Dockerfile (`'docker/Dockerfile`)'. Consider scalability and maintainability.

Refinement: Detail strategies for iteratively improving test coverage and quality *within each SPARC cycle*. This should include using code coverage tools to identify gaps, ensuring tests are robust and resilient to codebase changes, aligning test documentation with project documentation, and validating Docker Compose compatibility during refinement. Describe how feedback from each phase informs subsequent iterations.

Completion: Describe a process for finalizing the test suite after multiple SPARC cycles. Include steps to ensure 100% feature coverage (based on the Specification), cross-platform verification (if applicable), automated test execution within the specified Docker environment, and validation that the Docker setup functions as intended. Address CI/CD pipeline integration and comprehensive test report generation. Outline criteria for declaring a SPARC cycle complete and moving to the next.
